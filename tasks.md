# RemoteSync - Collaborative Remote Control Software
# This is the main context file which lays down all the steps, keep updating this file by checking off tasks that are completed and adding additional details in the ## Context to keep in mind section as we progress.

I want a simple remote control software with one server and 2 clients, the clients after connecting can choose which client's computer they want to control. Once chosen, both the clients should have simultaneous control over the controlled computer. Like 2 mouse pointers and 2 keyboard inputs for both the client whose computer is being controlled, and the client who is controlling the other client's computer. There must also be option by default to only allow one client to control a computer at a time.
